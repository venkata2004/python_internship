Using the provided weight and height parameters, I developed a BMI calculator to classify users into health categories like underweight, normal, and overweight. I utilized a command-line approach for beginners and a GUI-based version for advanced users using Tkinter, incorporating data storage and visualization features.

I created a random password generator that allows users to generate secure passwords based on customizable length and character preferences. The beginner version is command-line based, while the advanced version features a GUI with clipboard integration and security rule enforcement.
